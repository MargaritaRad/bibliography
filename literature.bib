abstract = {We estimate trends in intergenerational economic mobility by matching men in the Census to synthetic parents in the prior generation. We find that mobility increased from 1950 to 1980 but has declined sharply since 1980. While our estimator places greater weight on location effects than the standard intergenerational coefficient, the size of the bias appears to be small. Our preferred results suggest that earnings are regressing to the mean more slowly now than at any time since World War II, causing economic differences between families to become more persistent. However, current rates of positional mobility appear historically normal.},

abstract = {This paper reports estimates of the effects of JTPA training programs on the distribution of earnings. The estimation uses a new instrumental variable (IV) method that measures program impacts on quantiles. The quantile treatment effects (QTE) estimator reduces to quantile regression when selection for treatment is exogenously determined. QTE can be computed as the solution to a convex linear programming problem, although this requires first-step estimation of a nuisance function. We develop distribution theory for the case where the first step is estimated nonparametrically. For women, the empirical results show that the JTPA program had the largest proportional impact at low quantiles. Perhaps surprisingly, however, JTPA training raised the quantiles of earnings for men only in the upper half of the trainee earnings distribution.},

We use the model to evaluate the life-cycle return to apprenticeship training and find that on average the costs outweigh the benefits; however for those who choose to train the returns are positive. We then use our model to consider the long-term lifecycle effects of two reforms: One is the introduction of an Earned Income Tax Credit in Germany, and the other is a reform to Unemployment Insurance. In both reforms we find very significant impacts of the policy on training choices and on the value of realised matches, demonstrating the importance of considering such longer term implications.},

abstract = {Characterizing uncertainty in the assessment of evidence is common practice when communicating science to users, a prominent example being the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports (ARs). The IPCC guidance note is designed to assist authors in the assessment process by assuring consistent treatment of uncertainties across working groups (WGs). However, debate on this approach has surfaced among scholars on whether applying the guidance note indeed yields the desired consistent treatment of uncertainties thus facilitating effective communication of findings to users. The IPCC guidance note is therefore a paradigmatic case for reviewing concerns regarding treatment of uncertainties for policy. We reviewed published literature that outline disagreement or dissensus on the guidance note in the IPCC assessment process, structured as three distinct topics. First, whether the procedure is reliable and leads to robust results. Second, whether the broad scope of diverse problems, epistemic approaches, and user perspectives allow for consistent and appropriate application. Third, whether the guidance note is adequate for the purpose of communicating clear and relevant information to users. Overall, we find greater emphasis placed on problems arising from the procedure and purpose of the assessment, rather than the scope of application. Since a procedure needs to be appropriate for its purpose and scope, a way forward entails not only making deliberative processes more transparent to control biases. It also entails developing differentiated instruments to account for diversity and complexity of problems, approaches, and perspectives, treating sources of uncertainty as relevant information to users.},

abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with {\$}J {\textgreater} 2{\$} categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

abstract = {Das Sozio-oekonomische Panel (SOEP) ist als multidisziplin{\"{a}}res Haushaltspanel, das Informationen zu allen Personen, die in einem Panel-Haushalt leben, erhebt und damit alle Altersjahrg{\"{a}}nge abdeckt, nach 25 Jahren Laufzeit auch zu einer Kohorten- Studie geworden. Der zunehmende Erfolg der Forschungsinfrastruktur-Einrichtung SOEP speist sich in erster Linie daraus, dass die Analysekraft von L{\"{a}}ngsschnittstudien mit jedem weiteren Erhebungsjahr zunimmt. Hinzu kommen im Falle des SOEP seit Beginn an eine lange Reihe von Innovationen bei der Erhebung, Datenaufbereitung und Nutzer-Service. Deswegen gilt es zu {\"{u}}berlegen, wie die wissenschaftliche Power des SOEP weiter gest{\"{a}}rkt werden kann. Nicht zuletzt auch, da es f{\"{u}}r neue, spezialisierte Panel-Studien (wie das Nationale Bildungspanel oder das DFG-gef{\"{o}}rderte Familienpanel PAIRFAM) eine Referenz und ggf. Verankerung der Hochrechnung darstellt. Zudem kann das SOEP k{\"{u}}nftig eine gr{\"{o}}{\ss}ere Rolle als „Kontroll-Stichprobe“ f{\"{u}}r Interventions-Studien spielen; etwa im Bereich der Kindheitsentwicklung. Auf diese neuen Rollen muss es vorbereitet sein. Die im SOEP in den letzten Jahren realisierten Erhebungsinnovationen wie z. B. die Inkorporation psychologischer Konzepte, physische Gesundheitsmessungen (Greifkraft), die Messung kognitiver F{\"{a}}higkeiten und die Erprobung von Verhaltens- Experimenten werden in anderen Panel-Studien aufgegriffen und auf eine gr{\"{o}}{\ss}ere Stichprobenbasis gestellt. Im UK wird mit „Understanding Society“ ein Haushaltspanel mit 40.000 Haushalten begonnen; in den Niederlanden wird mit MESS ein Haushaltspanel von {\"{u}}ber 5.000 Haushalten f{\"{u}}r innovative Messmethoden zur Verf{\"{u}}gung gestellt. Die Erhebungsinhalte des SOEP werden von den Forschungs- und Politikberatungs-Communities unver{\"{a}}ndert stark nachgefragt. In UK hat ein f{\"{u}}r „Understanding Society“ breit angelegter Konsultationsprozess keine grunds{\"{a}}tzlich neuen Befragungsinhalte zu Tage gef{\"{o}}rdert, die das SOEP nicht bereits enth{\"{a}}lt oder die f{\"{u}}r das SOEP ohnehin im Gespr{\"{a}}ch sind. Wichtiger als die „Entdeckung“ v{\"{o}}llig neuer Erhebungsinhalte ist das thematische wie zeitliche „Zuschneiden“ der Details von Befragungsinhalten auf (zugespitzte) neue (theoretische) Fragestellungen und dabei gleichzeitig bew{\"{a}}hrte sowie viel genutzte zentrale Befragungsinhalte und deren Befragungsrhythmen beizubehalten. Das „Ma{\ss}schneidern“ von Erhebungsinhalten wird in den n{\"{a}}chsten Jahren die eigentliche Herausforderung f{\"{u}}r Infrastruktur- Erhebungen wie die PSID, „Understanding Society“ und das SOEP sein. Bei den Erhebungsinhalten sollten die „R{\"{a}}nder“ des Lebenslaufs eine gr{\"{o}}{\ss}ere Rolle spielen, da diese von Haushalts-Panels besonders gut erfasst werden k{\"{o}}nnen. Diese Verbesserungen der Erhebungen beziehen sich einerseits auf die f{\"{o}}tale Phase von in das SOEP hineingeborenen Kindern und die (fr{\"{u}}he) Kindheit, andererseits auf die letzte Lebensphase und das Sterben. In der Mitte des Lebenslaufs werden verbesserte Fragen zum Einkommen, Sparen und Verm{\"{o}}gen sowie auch psychologische Konstrukte eine zentrale Rolle spielen, au{\ss}erdem gezielte Fragen (event triggered questionnaires) in Verbindung mit zentralen Lebensereignissen wie z. B. Eheschlie{\ss}ung, Scheidung, Eintritt in und Austritt aus Arbeitslosigkeit. Es wird die Etablierung einer SOEP-“Innovations-Stichprobe“ vorbereitet, um theoriegeleitete Forschungsfragen gezielter unterst{\"{u}}tzen zu k{\"{o}}nnen. Dazu wird es auch notwendig sein, neue Messkonzepte zu erproben (z. B. die Erhebung von Biomarkern, qualitative Erhebungen, aber auch Experimente und gezielte Interventionsstudien). Um die Power von L{\"{a}}ngsschnittdaten von Anfang an f{\"{u}}r die Innovations-Stichprobe ausnutzen zu k{\"{o}}nnen, ist geplant, zwei kleinere Teilstichproben des SOEP, die seit 1998 bzw. 2006 laufen (Subsamples E und H), in die Innovationsstichprobe zu {\"{u}}berf{\"{u}}hren. Um die statistische Power langlaufender L{\"{a}}ngsschnittdaten entscheidend zu verbessern, sch{\"{a}}tzen wir eine Mindestfallzahl von etwa 500 Personen pro Geburtsund Alterskohorte f{\"{u}}r ausreichend ein. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, muss die Fallzahl des SOEP-Standard-Samples erh{\"{o}}ht werden. Als „Nebeneffekt“ werden dadurch wesentlich bessere Analysen f{\"{u}}r relativ kleine Gruppen in der Bev{\"{o}}lkerung m{\"{o}}glich; etwa f{\"{u}}r allein Erziehende oder bestimme Immigrantengruppen. Au{\ss}erdem verbessern sich als weiterer „Nebeneffekt“ auch regionale Analysem{\"{o}}glichkeiten, z. B. f{\"{u}}r die meisten Bundesl{\"{a}}nder und in gro{\ss}en Bundesl{\"{a}}ndern bis hin zu Regierungsbezirken (oder {\"{a}}hnlich abgegrenzten regionalen Einheiten). In letzter Zeit wird immer deutlicher, welche gro{\ss}e Bedeutung das SOEP als „Referenz-Datensatz“ f{\"{u}}r spezialisierte und vom SOEP v{\"{o}}llig unabh{\"{a}}ngige Erhebungen hat (neben Beobachtungsstudien, wie etwa Zwillings-Studien, auch Labor- und Interventions-Studien). Zur Unterst{\"{u}}tzung dieser Funktion ist eine neue Art von Service, der in Deutschland bislang nicht vorgehalten wird, notwendig (Beratung von Spezial-Erhebungen; ggf. Datenaufbereitung von l{\"{a}}ngsschnittlichen Spezial-Erhebungen), der auch in ein Datenservicezentrum eingebracht werden k{\"{o}}nnte. After 25 years as a multidisciplinary household panel containing information on all individuals residing in panel households and thus covering all age cohorts, the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) has become a true cohort study as well. The increasing success of the SOEP research infrastructure comes above all from the increasing analytical power that longitudinal studies attain with each successive survey year. In the case of SOEP, a long series of innovations in surveying, data preparation, and user service have also played a major role. For this reason, it is important to consider how the scientific capacity of SOEP can be further enhanced— not least of all since the SOEP can form a key point of reference (or “anchor”) for new, specialized panel studies (such as the National Educational Panel and the family panel PAIRFAM, funded by the German Research Foundation). Furthermore SOEP can become a kind of “control sample” for intervention studies, for example, in the field of child development. The SOEP survey and its governance structures must be prepared for these new tasks. The numerous innovations introduced into SOEP in recent years—questions dealing with psychological concepts, physical health measures (grip strength), measures of cognitive capabilities, and behavioral experiments—have been incorporated into other panel studies as well, and thus provided with a larger sample base. In the UK, the “Understanding Society“ household panel study was launched with 40,000 households; in the Netherlands, the MESS household panel study of over 5,000 households offered a new basis for testing innovative measurement methods. The results of the SOEP survey are in continuing high demand in the research and policy advisory community. From our point of view, the large-scale consultation process conducted to define the content of the UK survey “Understanding Society“ failed to identify any fundamentally new survey content that the SOEP either did not already contain or that was not already being discussed for the SOEP. More important than “discovering” entirely new survey areas is “tailoring” the details of existing survey content to address new, more specific (theoretical) questions, and thus maintaining proven and widely used elements of survey content. The “tailoring” of survey content will be the real challenge facing infrastructure surveys like PSID, “Understanding Society,” and the SOEP in the coming years. In the future, the “margins” of the life course should play a stronger role in survey content, since household panels are able to provide outstanding data of these life phases. The SOEP, and other household panel surveys, can be improved, on the one hand, by including the fetal phase of life and early childhood for children born into the panel, and on the other, by including late life and death. In the middle of the life course, improved questions on income, savings, and wealth as well as psychological constructs will play a central role, as will specific questions (in “eventtriggered” questionnaires) on central life occurrences such as marriage, divorce, and entry into and exit from unemployment. Current plans for SOEP foresee the addition of an “Innovation Sample” that will make it possible to better address theory-based research questions required for testing new measurement concepts (e.g., the surveying of biomarkers, qualitative surveys, but also experiments and targeted intervention studies). In order to exploit the power of longitudinal data from the outset, we plan to incorporate two smaller SOEP subsamples that have been running since 1998 and 2006 (Subsamples E and H, respectively) into the Innovation Sample. In order to decisively improve the statistical power of long-term longitudinal data, we believe that a minimum case number of about 500 persons per birth and age cohort is required. In order to reach this goal, the case number in the SOEP standard samples needs to be increased. A positive side-effect of this enlargement would be a significantly improved potential for analyses of relatively small groups within the population: for example, lone parents or specific immigrant groups. Another positive side-effect would be an improved potential for regional analyses: for example, for the majority of federal states. In recent times, the importance of SOEP as a “reference dataset” for specialized surveys which are independent from SOEP (observational studies such as twin studies, and laboratory and intervention studies) has become strikingly evident. To enhance this important function, new types of service are needed (advice on special surveys, possibly also data preparation for special surveys), which could become part of a Data Service Center.},

In particular, cross-sectional data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) are used, which include two measures of cognitive ability, one test of fluid mechanics (speed test) and another test of crystallised pragmatics (word fluency test). We find a positive relationship between cognitive abilities and economic activity, as workers with high ability test scores are less likely to be unemployed. In addition, results from Mincer-type OLS and 2SLS regressions suggest that mechanics abilities are correlated with wages in a significantly positive way for West German workers, even when educational attainment is controlled for, whereas pragmatics of cognition do not affect earnings significantly. However, we also find that ability and education are inseparable determinants of earnings, which confirms findings of recent studies for other countries.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the short-term effects of public smoking bans on individual smoking behavior. In 2007 and 2008, state-level smoking bans were gradually introduced in all of Germany's federal states. We exploit this variation to identify the effect that smoke-free policies had on individuals' smoking propensity and smoking intensity. Using rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, our difference-in-differences estimates show that the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Germany did not change average smoking behavior within the population. However, our estimates point to important heterogeneous effects. Individuals who go out more often to bars and restaurants did adjust their smoking behavior. Following the ban, they became less likely to smoke and also smoked less. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Applied economists have long struggled with the question of how to accommodate binary endogenous regressors in models with binary and nonnegative outcomes. I argue here that much of the difculty with limited dependent variables comes from a focus on structural parameters, such as index coefcients, instead of causal effects. Once the object of estimation is taken to be the causal effect of treatment, several simple strategies are available. These include conventional two-stage least squares, multiplicative models for conditional means, linear approximation of nonlinear causal models, models for distribution effects, and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor. The estimation strategies discussed in the article are illustrated by using multiple births to estimate the effect of childbearing on employment status and hours of work.},

Recent work shows how to frame dynamic discrete choice problems in a way that is conducive to CCP estimation and demonstrates that CCP estimators can be adapted to handle rich patterns of unobserved state variables.},

abstract = {This paper studies alternative empirical strategies for estimating the effects of organization design practices on performance, as well as the factors which determine organizational design, in a cross-section of firms. Our economic model is based on a firm where multiple organizational design practices are en endogenously determined, and these organizational design practices affect output through an 'organizational design production function.' The econometric model includes unobserved exogenous variation in the costs and returns to each of the individual practices. The model is used to evaluate how different econometric strategies for testing theories about complementarity can be interpreted under alternative assumptions about the economic and statistical environment. We identify plausible hypotheses about the joint distribution of the unobservables under which several different approaches from the existing literature will yield biased and inconsistent estimates. We show that the sign of the bias depends on two factors: whether the organzational design practices are complements, and the correlation between the unobserved returns to each practice. We find several sets of conditions under which the sign of the bias can be determined, and we provide economic interpretations. Our analysis shows that for a particular set of hypotheses, a variety of different procedures may all yield qualitatively similar biases, presenting a challenge for the identification of complementarity. We then propose a structural approach, which is based on a system of simultaneous equations describing productivity and the demand for organizational design practices. As long as exogenous variables are observed which are uncorrelated with the unobserved returns to practices, the structural parameters are identified, yielding consistent tests for complementarity as well as the cross-equation restrictions implied by static optimization of the organizatin's profit function.},

From the Bayesian viewpoint, probabilities should be assignable to everything, including the prospect of a player choosing a certain strategy in a certain game. The so-called game-theoretic viewpoint holds that probabilities can only be assigned to events not governed by rational decision makers; for the latter, one must substitute an equilibrium (or other game-theoretic) notion. The current formulation synthesizes the two viewpoints: Correlated equilibrium is viewed as the result of Bayesian rationality; the equilibrium condition appears as a simple maximization of utility on the part of each player, given his information. A feature of this approach is that it does not require explicit randomization on the part of the players. Each player always chooses a definite pure strategy,with no attempt to randomize; the probabilistic nature of the strategies reflects the uncertainty of other players about his choice. Examples are given.},

A stochastic dynamic game is proposed, and the security equilibrium solution of the game is shown to correspond to the value function under the worst model and the optimal controller. The authors demonstrate that the uncertain model approach can be used to solve a class of nearly Markovian Decision Problems, providing lower bounds on performance in stochastic models with higher-order interactions. The framework considered establishes connections between and generalizes paradigms of stochastic optimal, mini-max, and H1 /robust control. Applications are considered, including robustness in reinforcement learning, planning in nearly Markovian decision processes, and bounding error due to sensor discretization in noisy, continuous state-spaces.},

The large size of our earnings panel allows us to estimate and test richer models of earnings dynamics than could be supported by the relatively small panel surveys used in U.S. research. The Canadian data strongly reject several restrictions commonly imposed in the U.S. literature, and they also suggest that imposing these evidently false restrictions may lead to distorted inferences about earnings dynamics and inequality trends.},

abstract = {Imagine each family as a kind of little factory--a multiperson unit producing meals, health, skills, children, and self-esteem from market goods and the time, skills, and knowledge of its members. This is only one of the remarkable concepts explored by Gary Becker in his landmark work on the family. Becker applies economic theory to the most sensitive and fateful personal decisions, such as choosing a spouse or having children. He uses the basic economic assumptions of maximizing behavior, stable preferences, arid equilibria in explicit or implicit markets to analyze the allocation of time to child care as well as to careers, to marriage and divorce in polygynous as well as monogamous societies, to the increase and decrease of wealth from one generation to another. The consideration of the family from this perspective has profound theoretical and practical implications. For example, Becker's analysis of assortative mating can be used to study matching processes generally. Becker extends the powerful tools of economic analysis to problems once considered the province of the sociologist, the anthropologist, and the historian. The obligation of these scholars to take account of his work thus constitutes an important step in the unification of the social sciences. "A Treatise on the Family" will have an impact on public policy as well. Becker shows that social welfare programs have significant effects on the allocation of resources within families. For example, social security taxes tend to reduce the amount of resources children give to their aged parents. The implications of these findings are obvious and far-reaching. With the publication of this extraordinary hook, the family moves to the forefront of the research agenda in the social sciences.},

abstract = {The theory of inequality and intergenerational mobility presented in this essay assumes that each family maximizes a utility function spanning several generations. Utility depends on the consumption of parents and on the quantity and quality of their children. The income of children is raised when they receive more human and nonhuman capital from their parents. Their income is also raised by their "endowment" of genetically determined race, ability, and other characteristics, family reputation and "connections," and knowledge, skills, and goals provided by their family environment. The fortunes of children are linked to their parents not only through investments but also through these endowments acquired from parents (and other family members). The equilibrium income of children is determined by their market and endowed luck, the own income and endowment of parents, and the two parameters, the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest in children. If these parameters are both less than unity, the distribution of income between families approaches a stationary distribution. The stationary coefficient of variation is greater, the larger the degree of in-heritability and the smaller the propensity to invest in children. Intergenerational mobility measures the effect of a family on the well-being of its children. We show that the family is more important when the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest are larger. If both these parameters are less than unity, an increase in family income in one generation has negligible effects on the incomes of much later descendants. However, the incomes of children, grandchildren, and other early descendants could significantly increase; indeed, if the sum of these parameters exceeds unity, the changes in income rise for several generations before falling, and the maximum increase in income could exceed the initial increase.},

abstract = {Government emplyment and training programs typically do not have sufficient resources to serve all those who apply for assistance. Those to be served are usually selected by program staff based on management guidelines that allow considerable policy discretion at the local level. A longstanding issue in employment and training policy is wether allowing this flexibility leads to selection of applicants (1) most likely to benefit from the program or (2) who are likely to experience the highest absolute outcomes in the absence of program services, sometimes called "creaming". The distinction is crucial to the success of many programs, both as redistributional tools and as economic investments. Selection of those most likely to benefit from the program - i.e., those for whom the program's impact on subsequent labor market success will be greatest - will maximize the social return on the investment in training. In contrast, "creaming" may lead to little or no social benefit or to a substantial gain, depending on whether those selected for training - the group most likely to succeed without the treatment - in fact benefit most from it. The redistributional effects of a program will also depend on who is served: among the applicant group, a more equal distribution of economic well-being, ex post, will be achieved only if the program favors applicant likely to do worst without the intervention. This paper explores the role of creaming in the operation of seven welfare-to-work training programs, the type of programs that have been the focus of increased expenditures over the last 10 years as more and more welfare recipients have been pushed to become self-sufficient. It considers whether the program intake practices adopted in the studied programs furthered the social goals pursued and, if not, what consequences they had on the twin concerns of distributional equity and economic efficiency.},

The degree of self-control an individual can achieve is shown to rise with his self- confidence and decrease with prior external constraints. On the neg- ative side, individuals may adopt excessively rigid rules that result in compulsive behaviors such as miserliness, workaholism, or anorexia. We also study the cognitive basis of self-regulation, showing how it is constrained by the extent to which self-monitoring is subject to op- portunistic distortions of memory or attribution, and how rules for information processing can themselves be maintained.},

We apply our approach to the problem of maximizing the expected value of a payoff function when the underlying distribution is ambiguous and therefore robustness is relevant. Our primary objective is to develop this framework and relate it to the standard notion of robustness, which deals with only a single guarantee across one uncertainty set. First, we show that our approach connects closely to the theory of convex risk measures. We show that the complexity of this approach is equivalent to that of solving a small number of standard robust problems. We then investigate the conservatism benefits and downside probability guarantees implied by this approach and compare to the standard robust approach.

abstract = {This paper considers the use of statistical profiling to allocate persons to alternative options within government programs, or to participation or non-participation in programs Profiling has been used in the United States to allocate unemployment insurance (UI) claimants to reemployment services based on the predicted duration of their UI claim. We place profiling in the context of the choice among alternative assignment mechanisms. Different mechanisms have different costs and benefits — any one mechanism, whether profiling or something else, may not be optimal for every program. Within profiling systems, we highlight the need for clarity regarding the objective of the assignment mechanism, e.g. equity or efficiency, and we discuss situations in which equity and efficiency goals may conflict. In relation to UI profiling in the United States, we provide empirical evidence from the state of Kentucky on two important questions. First, we demonstrate that it is possible to effectively predict the duration of UI spells, but that effectively doing so requires using more covariates than many US states presently do. This finding is important because effective prediction of the profiling variable is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the success of a profiling system. Second, we show that the impact of reemployment services does not appear to vary with expected duration of the UI spell, indicating that UI profiling in Kentucky does not advance the goal of efficiency, though it may advance equity goals.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews various interactions between the distribution of income across individuals and factors of production on the one hand, and aggregate savings, investment, and macroeconomic growth on the other. Tractable models necessarily focus on specific causal channels within this complex web of interactions, and the survey is organized around a few relevant methodological insights. In a "neoclassical" economy where all intra- and intertemporal markets exist and clear competitively, all distributional issues should be resolved before market interactions address the economic problem of allocating scarce resources efficiently, and the dynamics of income and consumption distribution have no welfare implications. Other models, recognizing that market interactions need not maximize a hypothetical representative individual's welfare, let accumulated and nonaccumulated factors of production be owned by individuals with exogenously or endogenously different saving propensities, and feature interactions between the personal and functional distribution of resources and macroeconomic accumulation. Furthermore, rates of return to savings and investments are generally heterogeneous when they are only partially (if at all) interconnected by financial markets, as is the case in overlapping generation economies, in models with binding self-financing constraints, and in models where financial market imperfections let individual consumption flows be affected by idiosyncratic uncertainty. The chapter also reviews models where distributional tensions, far from being resolved ex ante, work their way through distortionary policies and market interactions to bear directly on both macroeconomic dynamics and income distribution. Finally, it relates theoretical insights to recent empirical work on cross-country growth dynamics and on relationships between within-country inequality and macroeconomic performance.},

To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

abstract = {Traditional models of decision-making under uncertainty assume perfect information, i.e., accurate values for the system parameters and specific probability distributions for the random variables. However, such precise knowledge is rarely available in practice, and a strategy based on erroneous inputs might be infeasible or exhibit poor performance when implemented. The purpose of this tutorial is to present a mathematical framework that is well-suited to the limited information available in real-life problems and captures the decision-makers attitude towards uncertainty; the proposed approach builds upon recent developments in robust and data-driven optimization. In robust optimization, random variables are modeled as uncertain parameters be- longing to a convex uncertainty set and the decision-maker protects the system against the worst case within that set. Data-driven optimization uses observations of the random variables as direct inputs to the mathematical programming problems. The first part of the tutorial describes the robust optimization paradigm in detail in single-stage and multi-stage problems. In the second part, we address the issue of constructing uncertainty sets using historical realizations of the random variables and investigate the connection between convex sets, in particular polyhedra, and a specific class of risk measures.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of the bootstrap for the most commonly applied procedures in inequality, mobility and poverty measurement. In addition to simple inequality index estimation the scenarios considered are inequality difference tests for correlated data, decompositions by sub-group or income source, decompositions of inequality changes, and mobility index and poverty index estimation. Besides showing the consistency of the bootstrap for these scenarios, the paper also develops simple ways to deal with longitudinal correlation and panel attrition or non-response. In principle, all the proposed procedures can be handled by the $\delta$-method, but Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the simplest possible bootstrap procedure should be the preferred method in practice, as it achieves the same accuracy as the $\delta$-method and takes into account the stochastic dependencies in the data without explicitly having to deal with its covariance structure. If a variance estimate is available, then the studentized version of the bootstrap may lead to an improvement in accuracy, but substantially so only for relatively small sample sizes. All results incorporate the possibility that different observations have different sampling weights. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Building on the work of Sianesi (2003, 2004), we employ propensity score matching methods in a dynamic, multiple treatment framework in order to address program heterogeneity and dynamic selection into programs. Our results suggest that in West Germany both short-term and medium-term programs show considerable employment effects for certain population subgroups but in some cases the effects are zero in the medium run. Short-term programs are surprisingly effective when compared to the traditional and more expensive longer-term programs. With a few exceptions, we find little evidence for significant positive treatment effects in East Germany. There is some evidence that the employment effects decline for older workers and for low-skilled workers.},

@article{Bilschak.2016,
abstract = {Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as expriments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First, you often need to experiment with new ideas, such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step, but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However, this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames, e.g., analisys.sh, analysis{\_}02.sh, analysis{\_}03.sh, etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the verions of the files and, more importantly, which version you used to produce specific results, especially if you return to the code months later. Second, you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators, and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes of them sends. Fortunately, software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code, Thus, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore, you can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. It also facilitates collaboration. Using a VCS, your collaborators can make and save changes to the code, and you can automatically incorporate these changes to the main code base. The collaborative aspect is enhanced with the emergence of websites that host version-controlled code.},

abstract = {The value of $\lambda$ is one of the main issues debated in international usability studies. The debate is centred on the deficiencies of the mathematical return on investment model (ROI model) of Nielsen and Landauer (1993). The ROI model is discussed in order to identify the base of another model that, respecting Nielsen and Landauer's one, tries to consider a large number of variables for the estimation of the number of evaluators needed for an interface. Using the bootstrap model (Efron 1979), we can take into account: (a) the interface properties, as the properties at zero condition of evaluation and (b) the probability that the population discovery behaviour is represented by all the possible discovery behaviours of a sample. Our alternative model, named Bootstrap Discovery Behaviour (BDB), provides an alternative estimation of the number of experts and users needed for a usability evaluation. Two experimental groups of users and experts are involved in the evaluation of a website (http://www.serviziocivile.it). Applying the BDB model to the problems identified by the two groups, we found that 13 experts and 20 users are needed to identify 80{\%} of usability problems, instead of 6 experts and 7 users required according to the estimation of the discovery likelihood provided by the ROI model. The consequence of the difference between the results of those models is that in following the BDB the costs of usability evaluation increase, although this is justified considering that the results obtained have the best probability of representing the entire population of experts and users.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. We investigate the regulation of labor markets through employment, collec tive relations, and social security laws in 85 countries. We find that the political power of the left is associated with more stringent labor regulations and more generous social security systems, and that socialist, French, and Scandinavian legal origin countries have sharply higher levels of labor regulation than do common law countries. However, the effects of legal origins are larger, and explain more ofthe variation in regulations, than those of politics. Heavier regulation of labor is associated with lower labor force participation and higher unemployment, especially of the young. These results are most naturally consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have pervasive regulatory styles inherited from the transplantation of legal systems.},

abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit-ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {The interpretation of instrumental variables (IV) estimates as local average treatment effects (LATE) of instrument-induced shifts in treatment raises concerns about their external validity and policy relevance. We examine how to move beyond LATE in situations where the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research. Discrete instruments do not give sufficient support to identify the full range of marginal treatment effects (MTE) in the usual local instrumental variable approach. We show how an alternative estimation approach allows identification of richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. One result is that the alternative approach identifies a linear MTE model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another result is that the alternative approach allows identification of a general MTE model under the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. We apply these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used binary instruments to estimate LATEs of family size on child outcomes. We show that the effects of family size are both more varied and more extensive than what the LATEs suggest. Our MTE estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude and even sign, and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.},

We argue that policy evaluation should be conducted on the basis of two factors: the policymaker's preferences, and the conditional distribution of the outcomes of interest given a policy and available information. From this perspective, the common practice of conditioning on a particular model is often inappropriate, since model uncertainty is an important element of policy evaluation. We advocate the use of model averaging to account for model uncertainty and show how it may be applied to policy evaluation exercises. We illustrate our approach with applications to monetary policy and to growth policy.},

abstract = {Carbon chain length in several classes of straight-chain aliphatic odorants has been proposed as a model axis of similarity for olfactory research, on the basis of successes of studies in insect and vertebrate species. To assess the influence of task on measured perceptual similarities among odorants and to demonstrate that the systematic similarities observed within homologous odorant series are not task specific, the authors compare 3 different behavioral paradigms for rats (olfactory habituation, generalization, and discrimination). Although overall patterns of odorant similarity are consistent across all 3 of these paradigms, both quantitative measurements of perceptual similarity and comparability with 2-deoxyglucose imaging data from the olfactory bulb are dependent on the specific behavioral tasks used. Thus, behavioral indices of perceptual similarity are affected by task parameters such as learning and reward associations.},

abstract = {Recent research on the economics of human development deepens understanding of the origins of inequality and excellence. It draws on and contributes to personality psychology and the psychology of human development. Inequalities in family environments and investments in children are substantial. They causally affect the development of capabilities. Both cognitive and noncognitive capabilities determine success in life but to varying degrees for different outcomes. An empirically determined technology of capability formation reveals that capabilities are self-productive and cross-fertilizing and can be enhanced by investment. Investments in capabilities are relatively more productive at some stages of a child's life cycle than others. Optimal child investment strategies differ depending on target outcomes of interest and on the nature of adversity in a child's early years. For some configurations of early disadvantage and for some desired outcomes, it is efficient to invest relatively more in the later years of childhood than in the early years.},

abstract = {This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for child cognitive and noncognitive skills. Output is determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of nonlinear factor models. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of cognitive skills. It increases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For some configurations of disadvantage and outcomes, it is optimal to invest relatively more in the later stages of childhood.},

abstract = {Research in child development reveals that the sources, level, stability, and uses of family resources have a profound effect on children's well-being and long-term outcomes. Although that research has incorporated economic constructs and measures, developmentalists generally ignore the formal economic framework for thinking about family resources and child outcomes. Building on the premise that children are an investment, that framework explains how families allocate resources and links that decision to other family choices and to key child outcomes, such as schooling, morbidity, and mortality among others. This article explains economists' general approach to family behavior (the so-called theory of household production) and then describes how that framework is useful for thinking about families and children. The article then outlines how economists model parental investment in children and examines the implications of that approach for developmental science. This discussion is illustrated using an example of interest to developmentalists--the involvement of children and adolescents in after-school activities. A concluding section discusses the benefits of and potential barriers to collaboration between economists and developmentalists.},

abstract = {The Speech Transmission Index (STI; Houtgast, Steeneken, {\&} Plomp, 1980; Steeneken {\&} Houtgast, 1980) is commonly used to quantify the adverse effects of reverberation and stationary noise on speech intelligibility for normal-hearing listeners. Duquesnoy and Plomp (1980) showed that the STI can be applied for presbycusic listeners, relating speech reception thresholds (SRTs) in various reverberant conditions to a fixed, subject-dependent STI value. The current study aims at extending their results to a wider range of hearing-impaired listeners.},

abstract = {... an excellent piece of work... a pleasure, and instructive to read. -Applied Statistics This book develops a general theory of upper and lower probabilities, and everyone interested in the foundations of statistical inference should own a copy... The book is at once a theory of partial belief, a formalization of Bayesian robustness, and a thorough (if dogmatic) critique of Standard Bayesian statistics... Even when I disagreed on a point, I found I gained much by having my assumptions challenged. The book is full of interesting material on many topics beside upper and lower probabilities... essential reading. -Journal of the American Statistical Association The making of this book has spanned a decade in time, and an odyssey that included New Zealand, England, Brazil, USA, and Venezuela. This commitment of thought and effort has produced a substantial contribution to foundations theory. -The Australian Journal of Statistics This is an impressive piece of work... clearly written... both a pleasure and instructive to read. -Journal of the Royal Statistical Society This is a deep and well-written study of imprecise probability... carefully worked out and worthy of serious attention. -Mathematical Reviews ... this is an excellent book. It is comprehensive, well-written, rigorous, and highly original... moves statistical reasoning and decision making to a new, higher level of sophistication. -International Journal of General Systems Reading the book with full use of the indexes and the notes is highly rewarding. Many issues which are often poorly discussed, for example, prior-data conflict, are gone into thoroughly. The book is a very rich source of examples and counterexamples. -Short Book Reviews of the International Statistical Institute Product Description This text presents a theory of probabilistic reasoning, statistical inference and decision. The book is concerned with the problems of reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, partial information and ignorance. It is argued that, in order to give appropriate weight to both ignorance and uncertainty, imprecise probabilities need to be assessed. The imprecision can be modelled mathematically by upper and lower probabilities or (more generally) upper and lower previsions. The degree of imprecision can reflect both the amount of information on which probabilities are based and the extent of conflict between different types of information. The book develops mathematical methods for reasoning using imprecise probabilities. These include methods for assessing probabilities, modifying the assessments to achieve coherence, updating them to take account of new information, and combining them to calculate other probabilities, draw conclusions and make decisions. The methods are extended in the second half of the book to construct a general theory of conditional probability and statistical inference. The mathematical theory is based on simple and compelling principles of avoiding sure loss, coherence and natural extension. Careful attention is given to the philosophical foundations, interpretation and justification of the theory. It is compared with alternate theories of inference, including Bayesian theories (which require all probability assesments to be precise), Bayesian sensitivity analysis, the Neyman-Pearson theory of confidence intervals, the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions and the theory of fuzzy sets. The theory is applicable to a wide range of disciplines including statistics, decision theory, economics, psychology, philosophy of science, management science, operations research, engineering and artificial intelligence. (References are given to related work in these fields). In fact, the theory has important implications for any field in which the problems of uncertainty and limited information are taken seriously. This book should be of interest to researchers in statistics and those in related disciplines.},

abstract = {The recent literature on instrumental variables (IV) features models in which agents sort into treatment status on the basis of gains from treatment as well as on baseline-pretreatment levels. Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coe cient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coe cient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and nd evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of gains.},

abstract = {Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectra of six crude oils from the eastern province of Saudi Arabia were excited using a pulsed laser radiation at 250 nm and measured at specific time gates (TG) within the leading and trailing edges of the laser temporal pulse. The spectra showed the presence of a shoulder near 380 nm that systematically decreased in intensity from high-grade to low-grade crudes, and also from earlier to later TGs. The intensities of these shoulders are shown to be useful in estimating the grades of crude oils, particularly when the TRF spectra are measured at TGs within the leading edge of the laser temporal pulse. Contour diagrams depicting the shapes of the TRF spectra as function of TG (within the leading and trailing edges) are also presented to serve as true fingerprints of the crudes.},

abstract = {The Akzo Nobel research laboratories formulated this problem in their study of the penetration of radio-labeled antibodies into a tissue that has been infected by a tumor. This study was carried out for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. The treatment of malignant diseases, after its primary treatment by surgery, is either by external beam radiotherapy, which is effective but local, or by chemoteraphy, which is effective but not selective. The radiotherapy labelled antibody has to be able to penetrate the whole of the tumour, whereas for imaging only uptake on the surface of the tumour is needed. Factors such as dose, rate delivered, tumor size, and radiosensitivity play a major role in determining therapeutic response, while target-to-nontarget ratios and, particularly, circulating radioactivity to the bone marrow determine the major dose-limiting toxicities. In this article, we introduced a system of differential equations with small parameter with applications in radioimmunotherapy. The problem consists of two partial differential equations. Both the equation of this system includes small parameter epsilon. We introduce the mathematical technique known as boundary function method for singular perturbation system. In this system, the small parameter is an asymptotic variable, different from the independent variable. We write solution of this system in a small parameter, and investigation of asymptotic solution for system. Using the program Matlab and numerical method Runge-Kutta, I did various simulations for different values of biological parameters presented in the model studied.},

abstract = {In this study, the results of the calibration of the complex activated sludge model implemented in BioWin software for the full-scale wastewater treatment plant are presented. Within the calibration of the model, sensitivity analysis of its parameters and the fractions of carbonaceous substrate were performed. In the steady-state and dynamic calibrations, a successful agreement between the measured and simulated values of the output variables was achieved. Sensitivity analysis revealed that upon the calculations of normalized sensitivity coefficient (S ( i,j )) 17 (steady-state) or 19 (dynamic conditions) kinetic and stoichiometric parameters are sensitive. Most of them are associated with growth and decay of ordinary heterotrophic organisms and phosphorus accumulating organisms. The rankings of ten most sensitive parameters established on the basis of the calculations of the mean square sensitivity measure ({\$}\delta{\$} ( j ) (msqr) ) indicate that irrespective of the fact, whether the steady-state or dynamic calibration was performed, there is an agreement in the sensitivity of parameters.},

abstract = {Context  Overweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions.  Objective  To describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of health conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population.  Design and Setting  Nationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994.  Participants  A total of 16,884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight and obese (body mass index [BMI] [{\textgreater}=]25 kg/m2) based on National Institutes of Health recommended guidelines.  Main Outcome Measures  Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis.  Results  Sixty-three percent of men and 55{\%} of women had a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater. A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with increasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for coronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women. With normal-weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes for men (PR, 18.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 6.7-46.8) and women (PR, 12.9; 95{\%} CI, 5.7-28.1) and gallbladder disease for men (PR, 21.1; 95{\%} CI, 4.1-84.2) and women (PR, 5.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger than in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased with weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups.  Conclusions  Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered overweight or obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to prevent and treat obesity rather than just its associated comorbidities.},

Opening with an editorial which analyses the immediate policy challenges and provides advice for OECD governments, and a first chapter that sets out the facts and figures related to recent employment developments and sets them in the broader economic context, this volume goes on to provide analysis in three specific policy areas: the jobs impact and policy response in emerging economies, institutional and policy determinants of labour market flows, and the quality of part-time work. The volume closes with a statistical annex which provides the latest available employment data. This book includes StatLinks, URLs under each graph and table linking to spreadsheets showing the underlying data.},

abstract = {Imagine a personal software agent engaging in electronic commerce on your behalf. Say the task of this agent is to track goods available for sale in various online venues over time, and to purchase some of them on your behalf for an attractive price. In order to be successful, your agent will need to embody your preferences for products, your budget, and in general your knowledge about the environment in which it will operate. Moreover, the agent will need to embody your knowledge of other similar agents with which it will interact (e.g., agents who might compete with it in an auction, or agents representing store owners)—including their own preferences and knowledge. Acollection of such agents forms amultiagent system. The goal of this book is to bring under one roof a variety of ideas and techniques that provide foundations for modeling, reasoning about, and building multiagent systems. Somewhat strangely for a book that purports to be rigorous, we will not give a precise definition of a multiagent system. The reason is that many competing, mutually inconsistent answers have been offered in the past. Indeed, even the seemingly simpler question—What is a (single) agent?—has resisted a definitive answer. For our purposes, the following loose definition will suffice: Multiagent systems are those systems that include multiple autonomous entities with either diverging information or diverging interests, or both.},

abstract = {A unique interdisciplinary foundation for real-world problem solving Stochastic search and optimization techniques are used in a vast number of areas, including aerospace, medicine, transportation, and finance, to name but a few. Whether the goal is refining the design of a missile or aircraft, determining the effectiveness of a new drug, developing the most efficient timing strategies for traffic signals, or making investment decisions in order to increase profits, stochastic algorithms can help researchers and practitioners devise optimal solutions to countless real-world problems. Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control is a graduate-level introduction to the principles, algorithms, and practical aspects of stochastic optimization, including applications drawn from engineering, statistics, and computer science. The treatment is both rigorous and broadly accessible, distinguishing this text from much of the current literature and providing students, researchers, and practitioners with a strong foundation for the often-daunting task of solving real-world problems. The text covers a broad range of today's most widely used stochastic algorithms, including: Random searchRecursive linear estimationStochastic approximationSimulated annealingGenetic and evolutionary methodsMachine (reinforcement) learningModel selectionSimulation-based optimizationMarkov chain Monte CarloOptimal experimental design The book includes over 130 examples, Web links to software and data sets, more than 250 exercises for the reader, and an extensive list of references. These features help make the text an invaluable resource for those interested in the theory or practice of stochastic search and optimization.},

abstract = {Emergent literacy consists of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are developmental precursors to reading and writing. This article offers a preliminary typology of children's emergent literacy skills, a review of the evidence that relates emergent literacy to reading, and a review of the evidence for linkage between children's emergent literacy environments and the development of emergent literacy skills. We propose that emergent literacy consists of at least two distinct domains: inside-out skills (e.g., phonological awareness, letter knowledge) and outside-in skills (e.g., language, conceptual knowledge). These different domains are not the product of the same experiences and appear to be influential at different points in time during reading acquisition. Whereas outside-in skills are associated with those aspects of children's literacy environments typically measured, little is known about the origins of inside-out skills. Evidence from interventions to enhance emergent literacy suggests that relatively intensive and multifaceted interventions are needed to improve reading achievement maximally. A number of successful preschool interventions for outside-in skills exist, and computer-based tasks designed to teach children inside-out skills seem promising. Future research directions include more sophisticated multidimensional examination of emergent literacy skills and environments, better integration with reading research, and longer-term evaluation of preschool interventions. Policy implications for emergent literacy intervention and reading education are discussed.},
